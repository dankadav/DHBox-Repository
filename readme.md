## Setting up a git repository

I am learning how to set up a git repository, how to make changes to that repository, and how to publish the repository on GitHub

I have made this folder and readme file, and have created a hidden directory called .git

I have now set up how I will make commits, helping me to keep track of my changes to the repository
